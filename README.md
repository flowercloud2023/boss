Project Highlights:

Objective: The main objective of this project is to streamline the recruitment process on the Boss Zhipin platform by automating various tasks and interactions.

Web Automation with Selenium:

The web automation script uses the Selenium framework to interact with the Boss Zhipin website.
It performs actions such as sending messages, clicking buttons, and scrolling through candidate profiles.
The script interacts with chat messages, sending images and predefined text.
Data is recorded and written to a database, including second-time greetings and communication details.
Mobile Automation with Airtest:

The mobile automation script uses the Airtest framework to automate interactions on the Boss Zhipin mobile app.
It handles both new greetings and responses to candidate messages.
The script simulates user interactions, sending predefined replies and requesting resumes.
Similar to the web script, data is recorded and stored in a database for future reference.
Efficiency and Scalability:
